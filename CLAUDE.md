# CLAUDE.md

Guidance for Claude Code working in this repository. Only what you can't infer from the code —
architecture is documented in [docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md) and the rest of `docs/`.

## What it is

A VS 2022/2026 extension (VSIX, C#/.NET Framework 4.8, `Corsinvest.VisualStudio.Agents`) that hosts
two pane types plus an in-process MCP server exposing the IDE to the CLI. The chat UI is a WebView2
app in TypeScript + Lit.

It **drives** the real `claude.exe` (npm `@anthropic-ai/claude-code`) — never bundled (licensing),
never forked. Version differences are handled by feature-detection, not by pinning a CLI version.

## The IDE is right there

When this solution is open in a Visual Studio running the extension, the `mcp__vs__*` tools reach
that IDE — the one that has built this code and holds its semantic model. Ask it rather than
shelling out or re-reading files: `ide_get_diagnostics` for what the compiler thinks,
`nav_find_references` for callers, `ide_read_output` for what a build or a debug session printed.
The extension is its own best test case, so the IDE you are talking to is usually running the
build you just made.

## Build

Use `mcp__vs__build_solution` when that IDE is open: it drives it, so there is no MSBuild path to
resolve and no clash with a debug session holding the assembly, and the errors come back as
file/line/message. Otherwise:

```powershell
msbuild cv4vs-agents.slnx /t:Build /p:Configuration=Debug   # WebView build is hooked into MSBuild
```

WebView (`src/Corsinvest.VisualStudio.Agents/Chat/WebViewSrc/`): `npm run build` / `dev` /
`typecheck` / `lint`.

**Installs stack up.** VS keys extensions by `Identity Id`, so a build with a changed identity —
or a changed display name — installs *alongside* the old one: duplicate menu entries, two MCP
servers, and symptoms that look like bugs in the code. `tools\extension.ps1` is the test cycle
(remove every copy, then install into the Exp hives); `-Uninstall` clears them and refreshes the
hives, which deleting the folder alone does not — VS keeps serving the cached menu entries.

**Unit tests exist, and cover less than the extension does.** `tests/Corsinvest.VisualStudio.Agents.Tests`
holds ~195 xUnit tests over the pure logic — the JSONL readers, the content-block translator, meta
injection, stats, schema building. Run them:

```powershell
dotnet test tests\Corsinvest.VisualStudio.Agents.Tests\Corsinvest.VisualStudio.Agents.Tests.csproj
```

**Build first, then test — that order IS the gate.** The project takes a `<Reference>` on the built
`Corsinvest.VisualStudio.Agents.dll`, not a `ProjectReference` (a legacy VSIX resolves its
dependencies through packages.config, and the modern SDK rebuilding it buries the run in CS0246).
So `dotnet test` after editing a `.cs` and nothing else tests the PREVIOUS build — silently, and it
will look like your change is covered when nothing ran it.

Everything else — WPF, the WebView, the MCP surface, anything touching the VS shell — is verified by
hand in the Exp instance (F5 → `devenv /rootsuffix Exp`). A green build proves less than it looks:
XAML `x:Class`, `.vsct` ids and the manifest fail at *runtime*, not compile time — a mismatched
`.vsct` id gives a silent no-op menu entry. **CI does not run the tests**, so a red suite reaches
master unless someone ran it.

`tests/LangMatrix` is not a test project: five throwaway libraries the solution loads but never
builds, so the `nav_*` tools can be pointed at a real file in each language.

## Traps

Things that break in ways the compiler won't tell you about:

- **New `.cs` files must be added by hand to `<Compile>` in the `.csproj`** — explicit items, no
  glob. A file that compiles in VS can be silently missing from the MSBuild VSIX.
- **`CLAUDE_CODE_ENTRYPOINT=claude-vscode`** is mandatory when launching the CLI: without it
  `initialize` returns a reduced payload (no Fable / `unavailable_models`).
- **`Newtonsoft.Json` pinned to 13.0.1** — the version VS forces at runtime; a higher one throws
  `MissingMethodException`. Use `JsonExtensions.ToIndentedString`, not `JToken.ToString(Formatting)`.
- **Target framework v4.8**, not 4.7.2 — required by `Community.VisualStudio.Toolkit`.
- **`bridge-messages.ts` is generated** from `Chat/Host/BridgeMessages.cs` by
  `WebViewSrc/tools/gen-bridge.mjs` (part of `npm run build`). The C# file is the single source of
  truth — never edit the `.ts`.
- **`~/.claude/` paths and `claude.exe` names are the CLI's contract**, not ours. `ClaudePaths`,
  `ClaudeClient` and `ClaudeInstall` are named after what they drive: leave them alone.
- **`AppConstants.AppId`** names `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Corsinvest\<AppId>\` (profiles, WebView2 profile,
  caches). Changing it moves the user's data.
- **`.gitignore` excludes `[Dd]ebug/`** with an explicit exception for `Mcp/Tools/Debug/`. Renaming
  paths without updating it silently untracks those tools.

## Architecture notes

Full description in [docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md). What matters when editing:

- **The two startup paths are deliberately separate** — Chat (stream-json + in-process SDK MCP) and
  CLI (ConPTY + `--ide` WebSocket). Do **not** try to unify them.
- **Hot-swap, not respawn**: `set_model`, `set_permission_mode` and `interrupt` go to the live
  process on stdin. Only a working-directory change, `--resume` of another session or a fork may
  respawn it. Changing model or permission mode must never kill the process.
- **The wire is the reference.** For protocol questions, conform to what the CLI actually
  emits/accepts on stdio for the `claude-vscode` entrypoint — including its deliberate
  camelCase/snake_case inconsistencies.
- **Sessions are the CLI's own `.jsonl` files**, read with head+tail 64 KB windows (never the whole
  file). The scan matches on strings for speed, so it must stay whitespace-tolerant: use `IsType` /
  `IsFlagTrue`, not a literal `"type":"x"` — a pretty-printed writer is valid JSON too.

## Conventions

- SPDX header on every source file (`GPL-3.0-only`, Copyright Corsinvest Srl).
- **Comments in English**, always — including in files whose prose is Italian. Only the non-obvious
  *why*, kept short; no narration of what the code already says. Applies to C#, TS and CSS.
- **MCP tools are language-agnostic.** Roslyn per-document language services (via reflection) or
  language-agnostic APIs (`EnvDTE`, VS commands) — never a C#/VB-only path (`SymbolFinder`,
  `Renamer`, `ICallHierarchyService`). Where a capability isn't available, feature-detect and return
  `supported=false`. Naming: `domain_verb[_object]`, snake_case, domain first (≥3 tools to earn a
  domain, else `ide`); the `mcp__vs__` prefix is added automatically.
  - **`AlwaysLoad` is for the four that answer "what is the user looking at now"** (the editor
    selections, open files, diagnostics). Everything else is deferred and costs nothing until the
    CLI looks it up, which is why the catalogue can grow without slowing anything down — an
    always-loaded tool costs ~50 tokens of context on *every* turn, so adding a fifth needs a
    reason of that size.
  - **Two tools, not one with a mode flag, when the choice changes what works afterwards.**
    `debug_start` vs `debug_start_no_debugger`: after the second, nothing in `debug_get_*` will
    ever have anything to report. A flag hides that behind a value the caller set turns ago; two
    names put the consequence in the choice. Same reason `debug_set_breakpoint` and
    `debug_set_function_breakpoint` stay apart — there, merging would also cost the schema its
    `required` fields.
- **List output must be sorted** — Roslyn collects in parallel and VS collections don't guarantee
  order. Typically file (OrdinalIgnoreCase), then line, then column/name.
- **Fluent UI components stay pure** — only layout CSS (display, flex, gap, padding, position,
  width) on `<fluent-*>`; never colours, borders, shadows or token overrides.
- **Logging** (`OutputWindowLogger`, gated by Options → Debug → Log level, default None):
  - `LogException(ctx, ex)` always written; `Perf(...)` gated by EnablePerfLog.
  - **Warn** — a recovered anomaly on a user-facing path ("why the thing you asked for didn't
    happen"). **Info** — few, key lifecycle events. **Debug** — the internal flow of one feature.
    **Trace** — raw wire traffic. Use the lazy `() => $"..."` overloads for Debug/Trace.
  - Prefix new logs with an `[area]` tag (`[client]`, `[mcp]`, `[cli]`, `[sessions]`, …).
  - **One class, two ways to get it.** `OutputWindowLogger.For(kind, () => paneId)` builds a
    per-session logger that prepends `[chat#N]`/`[cli#N]` before the `[area]` tag — with several
    panes open the Output window is one stream, and untagged lines can't be told apart. The id is a
    `Func<int>` because `PaneId` lands *after* the control is built; capturing the value would tag
    every start-up line `#0`. `OutputWindowLogger.Global` writes untagged.
  - A pane injects its logger into what it owns (bridge, handler, client, transport, sessions), so
    those classes take it in the constructor. A class used both ways (`ClaudeClient`,
    `SessionManager`) takes it as an optional arg and falls back to `Global`.
  - Use `Global` for: paths belonging to no session (MCP, IDE, package, stats); **static members**,
    which have no instance to reach — in a primary-constructor class the parameter isn't even in
    scope there (`CS9105`); and process-wide resources reached from a pane, like `ChatWebView`'s
    shared task manager, where a pane tag would claim an ownership that isn't there.
  - The Output window pane itself is process-wide, so `EnsurePaneOnUIThread`/`ActivatePane` stay
    static: one pane for the extension, whoever logs into it.
  - When converting a class, convert **every partial** of it: the compiler won't tell you that one
    file still logs untagged.
  - A catch returning a default on a user-facing path must `LogException` or `Warn` — never swallow.

## Docs

`docs/*.md` is public and **written in English** (README, options, mcp-tools, sub-agents,
architecture, context-and-usage, settings-and-data).

`docs/marketplace-overview.md` is the odd one out: it is not documentation but the listing text.
`vs-publish.json` points the release workflow at it, so a stable tag uploads it along with the
package — the file in git *is* what the Marketplace shows. Its images still need absolute
`raw.githubusercontent.com` URLs: the portal resolves nothing relative.

That manifest carries the rest of the listing too (categories, Q&A, price). Publishing overwrites
them, so a field changed on the portal and not there is reverted by the next release.
